  |   whereabouts and rouse the legendary Wind Fish, explore Koholint       |
  |   Island and all its trap-ridden dungeons, reimagined in stunning       |
  |   detail for this new release of one of the most beloved The Legend     |
  |   of Zelda games. Along the way, you'll meet a hilarious assortment     |
  |   of charming characters to which you'll never want to say goodbye.     |

  |   reborn with new arrangements, and now you can equip more items at     |
  |   once, review key conversations, and navigate the map in new ways.     |
  |   Try your hand at the renovated mini-games to earn dolls based on      |
  |   the Super Mario series...or Chamber Stones. These unusual stones      |
  |   can be used to arrange your own Chamber Dungeons; each one is a       |
  |   puzzle in and of itself! Place chambers from dungeons found           |
  |   throughout the game on a series of objective-based grids... Where     |
  |   should the bosses go? How do you get from the entrance to the         |
  |   stairwell? They're your dungeons, so arrange them however you see     |
  |   fit. To earn more Chamber Stones, you must conquer the main           |
  |   adventure's dungeons and mini-games or tap any amiibo featuring a     |
  |   The Legend of Zelda character to unlock Chambers exclusive to         |
